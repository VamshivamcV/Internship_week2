          This blog application is built using <strong>React</strong> and the <strong>Context API</strong> for global state management. It demonstrates how to structure a modern React app with multiple pages using React Router, and manage shared data like blog posts and user info efficiently across components.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The project is styled using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to provide a clean, responsive design that works across all devices. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly example of how to use functional components, custom hooks, and built-in tools like the Context API to create scalable and maintainable UI applications.
        </p>

          This blog can be extended with features like post creation, editing, deleting, user authentication, and even a backend connection using APIs or databases. It's a great starting point for learning React in a real-world context.
